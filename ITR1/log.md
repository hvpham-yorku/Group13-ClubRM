## Concerns


- **Time management:** A lot of our group members underestimated just how daunting the project would be and were not on tasks with the work that they had to put out consistently
- **Testing coverage:** Test files were an after thought in the software development cycle and the team aims to improve upon them and add more details to them and ensure that all unit tests pass
- **Coordination:** With each team member working on separate pages, ensuring UI consistency required extra effort. The shared UI primitives helped, but a design system document would further improve this.


---

## Major Design Decisions & Rationale

- **Decision:** Simplistic design as opposed to our convoluted everything-app discussion
- **Rationale:** As per the customer's requests, we went with focusing on simplicity rather than versatility of our app so that we also aren't copying other products similar to ours but, instead, we are focused on making it user friendly and still aiming to make it a strong competitor when it comes to professional contact.

---

## Plan Revisions

- **Original Plan (ITR0):** We had the plan to make our very own CRM (ClubRM) to be able to do everything that other CRMs (like Salesforce, Monday, and Zoho) but built specifically for student associations and clubs, essentially pitching a business tool used in the industry but would be used for students, by students.
- **Revised Plan (ITR1):** After talking to the customer, we still have the general idea down, but downsized a bit to ensure that we are able to deliver and prioritize an easier time for our users and to also ensure that the simplicity in its design would attract more users.
- **Revised Plan (ITR3):** During ITR3, we had to revise our schedule to address a bottleneck. We had repeatedly pushed back the implementation of the Professional Contact Page in favor of core infrastructure. In the final weeks, we shifted priorities to ensure this page was fully functional with end-to-end database connectivity, as it is a core value proposition for our customer.
- **Reason for Change:** Time Considerations and Ensuring that Final Product is implemented before Deadline.
